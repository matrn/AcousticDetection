## Directories
- `lib/` - additional KiCad libraries used for the PCB
- `gerber/` - gerber export ready for production, it containes `single/` version where all three parts are in the same file and `separated/` for three separated gerber files
- `FORMODEL-AcousticDetection_HW/` - copy of this main `AcousticDetection_HW` PCB files, used for the images export into final thesis. Do not use this for production.
- `plots/` - PDF plots of schematic & PCB layout
