## 3D design problems
- SPH0645 mics (SMD part) collide with design - there should be a small rectangular hole
- ESP32's pin headers are blocked by 2 of 4 cylinders on the back side
- cylinders holes for ESP32 are too big for the M3 screw without a threaded insert
- hole for cables in the arms should be a little bit bigger
